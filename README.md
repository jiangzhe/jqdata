# jqdata
![Rust](https://github.com/jiangzhe/jqdata/workflows/Rust/badge.svg?branch=master)

Rust implementation of JQData

Current version is 0.2. 
This implementation is based on reqwest crate.
Since reqwest uses tokio 0.2 as async runtime, users need to setup runtime for it.

The old version 0.1 is deprecated.
